## For Loops

- What did we discover?

-- i++, going up incrementally by 1
  -- equivalent: var i = i + 1;
    - `i--, i += 1; i *= 2;`

  -- There are 3 main parts that make up a for loop
    - initialization: declare var / iterator
    - condition: comparing i to a number
      - determines how long the loop runs
    - final expression
      - i++
      - happens AFTER the block of code runs

- What are for loops good for?
  -- for arrays, especially if you want to know specific values

- Are there other ways of looping / iterating over content?
  -- Yes, there is more than one way of looping
    -- for statement
    -- do .. while loop
    -- while loop
    -- for in, for of

- What questions do we have?

- Gotchas
  - infinite loop
